Our GUI application is a user interface that enables users( University Students) to create a society, delete a society, access to events 
page, ability to hold elections.
Create Society : Any student can create a society (The creator is the president of the society until the president is elected)
Delete Society : This functionality is only for a president of the society

** Extra Functionalities**
Events: This particular functionality is for any user to create and event and view events write then and there..
Elections: Any student user can elect for any society and votes can be stored but some of this feature is still is under construction

Our Main features are implemented.. We made sure that Our GUI code is not tied up with our java source code inorder to make it more flexible(used a pattern)
We have a better design coming up soon.
